# Development Roadmap: Crowd-Powered Compliance Platform

## Phase 0: Pre-Development & Feasibility (2-3 Weeks)

Before committing to the full 6-week MVP build, a critical pre-development phase will ensure the project is built on a solid foundation of stakeholder buy-in and technical viability.

- **Goal**: Secure pilot partners and validate all external technical dependencies.
- **Key Outcomes**:
  - **Stakeholder Alignment**:
    - [ ] Identify and engage with 3-5 potential pilot authorities.
    - [ ] Conduct co-design workshops to validate their pain points and confirm the value proposition.
    - [ ] Secure written agreement from at least two authorities to participate in the pilot.
  - **Technical Feasibility**:
    - [ ] Confirm access to and assess the reliability of external APIs for merchant and jurisdiction data.
    - [ ] Develop a proof-of-concept for the core geospatial matching logic.
  - **Go/No-Go Decision**:
    - [ ] A clear decision is made on whether to proceed with the MVP based on the outcomes above.

## Phase 1: MVP Development (6 Weeks)

*This phase begins after a successful "Go" decision from Phase 0.*

The MVP is designed to deliver the core, end-to-end functionality of the platform in three distinct, two-week sprints.

#### **Weeks 1-2: Foundation**

- **Goal**: Establish the core infrastructure and application scaffolding with accessibility in mind.
- **Key Outcomes**:
  - [ ] Infrastructure is deployed (PostgreSQL/PostGIS, Redis, S3).
  - [ ] Backend and frontend applications are scaffolded with basic authentication.
  - [ ] Initial external data (jurisdictions, merchants) is integrated.
  - [ ] Multi-language support framework is implemented in the frontend.
  - [ ] Application is built to adhere to WCAG 2.1 AA standards from the start.

#### **Weeks 3-4: Core Reporting & Matching**

- **Goal**: Implement the complete report submission and authority matching workflow.
- **Key Outcomes**:
  - [ ] Users can submit reports with media (anonymous and registered).
  - [ ] Automated authority matching by location and violation type is functional.
  - [ ] Fallback logic to route reports to a regional coordinator is implemented.
  - [ ] Initial automated content screening (spam, profanity) is active.

#### **Weeks 5-6: Dashboards & Pilot Readiness**

- **Goal**: Build the necessary interfaces for authorities and human moderators to manage reports.
- **Key Outcomes**:
  - [ ] Authority dashboard is live with a filterable report queue and basic case history view.
  - [ ] Human moderation interface is functional for reviewing flagged content.
  - [ ] A moderation audit trail is implemented to log all decisions.
  - [ ] The platform is tested, secured, and ready for pilot deployment.

## Success Criteria

#### **Pilot Launch Targets (First Month)**

- **Adoption**: 3+ public authorities actively using the dashboard.
- **Engagement**: 50+ valid reports submitted by citizens.
- **Efficiency**: <24-hour average time for a report to be assigned to the correct authority.

## Post-MVP Evolution

The platform will evolve to enhance user engagement, decentralize moderation, and provide deeper insights.

- **Phase 2: Advanced Dashboards & Notifications**
  - Implement a robust notification system for all user roles.
  - Enhance the authority dashboard with an interactive map view and advanced analytics.

- **Phase 3: Community Reputation & Review**
  - Introduce a community reputation system to score reporters.
  - Enable trusted community members to participate in the review process, reducing the load on hired moderators.

- **Phase 4: Advanced Intelligence**
  - Explore AI-driven insights for predictive compliance and optimized resource allocation for authorities.
