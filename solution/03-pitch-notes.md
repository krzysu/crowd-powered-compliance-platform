# Verbal Pitch Outline: Crowd-Powered Compliance Platform

### 1. Opening Hook

Public agencies are struggling to enforce compliance. They lack the resources for proactive monitoring, which means many violations go unnoticed. We’re here to fix that by building a simple, effective bridge between the public and the officials who can act.

### 2. Quick Concept Recap

We’re building a platform where a citizen can report a compliance issue—like a restaurant not using reusable packaging. The report is geotagged, and our system automatically routes it to the correct public authority using a **two-factor system**: matching both **location** and **violation type**.

It’s a direct, efficient line from a real-world observation to the right official’s dashboard.

### 3. How It Works: The Core Loop

The MVP flow is a clean, three-step process:

1.  A citizen submits a report with location and media via our accessible web app.
2.  Our Go backend intelligently matches the report to the correct authority and screens it for quality.
3.  The authority official views and manages verified, actionable reports on a secure dashboard.

This creates a fully closed loop, from citizen to authority, right from day one.

### 4. Our Technology: Pragmatic & Scalable

We’re using a focused, high-performance stack to move fast and build a solid foundation:

- **Frontend:** A single **React SPA**, built to be responsive and accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA).
- **Backend:** A **Go monolith** with clear service boundaries. It’s fast to build and easy to scale or break apart later.
- **Database:** **PostgreSQL with PostGIS** is the core of our intelligent matching logic.
- **Key Principles**: The system is designed with **multi-language support** from day one and a strong commitment to **data privacy (GDPR)**.

### 5. Data Quality & Trust

We’re allowing anonymous reporting to maximize participation, and we ensure authorities get high-quality data—not noise—with a hybrid moderation strategy:

- **Automated Screening**: An initial filter for spam and profanity.
- **Human Review**: A clear queue for our moderators to handle flagged or ambiguous reports.
- **Data Integration**: We keep our data current by syncing with external sources like business registries and official jurisdiction maps.

### 6. The Plan: 6 Weeks to Pilot-Ready MVP

This isn’t a long-term research project. We have a focused **6-week plan** to launch a pilot-ready MVP.

- **Weeks 1-2**: Foundation & Infrastructure.
- **Weeks 3-4**: Core Reporting & Matching Logic.
- **Weeks 5-6**: Authority Dashboard & Launch Readiness.

**Our pilot success criteria are clear**: 3+ authorities actively using the system and an average report assignment time of less than 24 hours.

### 7. Future Vision: Beyond the MVP

The MVP is just the start. Once we validate the core loop, we will evolve the platform:

- **Phase 2: Advanced Dashboards & Notifications**: Close the feedback loop with citizens and provide richer data visualizations for authorities.
- **Phase 3: Community Reputation & Review**: Empower trusted community members to help with the review process, scaling moderation.
- **Phase 4: Advanced Intelligence**: Use AI to deliver predictive insights, helping authorities become more proactive.

### 8. Closing

This platform turns everyday observations into structured, actionable data. It’s a lightweight, tech-enabled way to build a more efficient and responsive government. Thank you.
